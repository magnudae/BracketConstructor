This temporary application will create the Brackets for the honreplays wiki.
It is NOT fully tested on different types of bracket-making sites, but will at this moment work for It's Gosu's brackets.
How to:
1. Download the application.
2. Compile the BracketConstructor.java
3. Make a .txt file and copy the whole bracket in text to that file.
4. Then run the application and you will have a file OutputFile.txt.
5. Copy the content into the wiki and you are done.
